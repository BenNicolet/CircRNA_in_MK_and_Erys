This repository contains scripts used in Nicolet et al. 2021 published in RNA Journal ( https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.078754.121 ) on the study of circRNA in megakaryoid and erythroid differentiation

The circRNA count was computed using DCC 0.4.3 ( https://github.com/dieterich-lab/DCC ) and CircExplorer2 ( https://github.com/YangLab/CIRCexplorer2 ). 
For further details, please refer to the methods section of our paper, or the scripts present in this repository.
